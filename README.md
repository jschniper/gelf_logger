# GelfLogger [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/abhurtun/gelf_logger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/abhurtun/gelf_logger)

A logger backend that will generate Graylog Extended Log Format messages. The
current version only supports UDP messages.

## Configuration

In the config.exs, add gelf_logger as a backend like this:

```
config :logger,
  backends: [:console, {Logger.Backends.Gelf, :gelf_logger}]
```

In addition, you'll need to pass in some configuration items to the backend
itself:

```
config :logger, :gelf_logger,
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 12201,
  application: "myapp",
  compression: :gzip, # Defaults to :gzip, also accepts :zlib or :raw
  metadata: [:request_id, :function, :module, :file, :line]
```

## Usage

Just use Logger as normal.

## Improvements

- [x] Tests
- [ ] TCP Support
- [x] Options for compression (none, zlib)
- [x] Send timestamp instead of relying on the Graylog server to set it
- [x] Find a better way of pulling the hostname

And probably many more. This is only out here because it might be useful to
someone in its current state. Pull requests are always welcome.

Credit where credit is due, this would not exist without
